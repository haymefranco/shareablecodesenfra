- Added some CSS scripts for the homepage design

DESCRIPTION:
Hello! 

I'm working on completely redoing our website. 

First, I'd like to change our "skin" to "Atlanta" in blue 
http://gallery.chiromatrix.com/theme/chiromatrix-chiropractic-general-atlanta/?color=atlanta-blue&live-preview=1 

I'd like to have the location removed from all pages. 

I need our blog to have a link that actually takes you to the blog posts. 

That's a great starting place so I can then go in and redo some of the 
content. How easy are the widgets to turn on an off? Is that something I 
need to ask you to do or can I do that from the dashboard? 
Will all our content be carried over to the new skin just fine? 

Also, on our dashboard when you click "Website Analytics" it says "Client 
Error 500: You don't have active websites" 
Can we get this fixed?

Our program is called Alpha Weight Loss and we're not like the rest! Other weight loss plans are mostly about cutting calories and exercising more. If this were the best approach, would there still be 60% of us overweight? With our plan, there is minimal exercise required.  We are using some advanced techniques that get tremendous results.

5) Can there be created a rotating picture gallery of clients' pets, etc.?
     - Page Added (only 2 images are found)

6) At the bottom of the page (where the picture of the boxer with the
stethoscope is located), can the brand logos I support be added. I am
currently collecting them in one file to be sent to you next week. 
     - LOGOS ARE NOT LOCATED IN THE MEDIA LIBRARY

7) Blogs are still old from 2017. I thought I was told that these
blogs were routinely updated. What is iMatrix's definition of routinely?
      - I have no clue on how to update their blogs.

9) Can a search option button for the website be added underneath the
Hospital's phone number for those who do not want to go through all the
headings? 
      - there are no Search buttons for Portal

10) What is the password to access admin log in. To send a message, it
goes to info@nodavethosp.com <info@nodavethosp.com> . When you click
on pet portal, it asks for a password! How are we supposed to access that?
Can the question just open straight into the email address? 
      - Unable to answer this.

12) What is the Browser compatibility? Under Internet Explorer, the site
is not found. Under Chrome it does not work.
      - I have tried it on both IE and Chrome. It works just fine.

13) Under the Services We Offer, it is blank. Under About Us it listed.
      - Completed but Confusing.

16) Can client feedback be linked to info@nodavethosp.com
      - Added a Link to the Navigation Bar for Client Feedback to mailto: info@nodavethosp.com

17) The icons that Jai sent to you for social media.Can those be placed
where "exclusive offer" is currently located? She should have also sent a
link to Doc's Corner as part of the social media.
      - No Icons were found in the Media Library

- Unable to complete:
- We do not offer trigger points (services tab) 
- Can we move the testimonials up to the top of the page? 
- The youtube link is VERY old and shows the old office info :) 
- In "what to expect" section, we do not have any nurse practitioners so 
that needs to be re-worded.

- DONE: Dr. Panuska’s bio:
- DONE: Bio for Amanda:
- DONE: Bio for Amber:
- DONE: Bio for Audrey:
- DONE: Bio for Emily:
- DONE: Bio for Heather:
- RE-MADE THE STAFF BIOS
- DONE: 1) On the Homepage and under “Meet Our Skilled Team”, when you click on “Read More” under each individual staff member it doesn’t go to the rest of that person’s bio.  It instead goes to an old “Meet Our Team” from the first time was with iMatrix.
- DONE: 2) Under “About Us” “Our Veterinarians” and when you click on “Read More”, it goes to an old “Meet Our Team” page.  Is it possible to just have the bio extended down the page when someone clicks on “Read More” instead of jumping to another page?
- DONE: 3) Under “About Us” “Our CareTeam”, is it possible to change that tab from “Our CareTeam” to just “Our Team”?
- DONE: 4) Under “About Us” “Our CareTeam” and when you click on “Read More”, it jumps to an old page of “Meet Our Team” page.  Is it possible to just have the bio extended down the current page when someone clicks on “Read More” instead of jumping to another page?
- UNABLE TO COMPLETE: Scripts on original theme is out of scope. I can not further edit on this one. 5) On the Homepage and when you click on “Veterinary Topics”, the screen goes to a black background before switching back to white and a list of articles.  It does the same thing every time you click on one of the categories or click on “Read More” under “Feature Articles” on the Homepage.
- DONE: 6) Under “Resources”, is it possible to add another tab there “Veterinary Articles” to contain all the articles you have under “Veterinary Topics” on the Homepage and at the bottom of the Homepage. I don’t want to get rid of what is on the Homepage but just for those that don’t like scrolling down, this way they could find the articles from the Menu Bar.
- DONE: 7) On the Homepage, you added the clinic video under right-hand side of “Welcome to Friendship Animal Hospital”. Is it also possible to add a button there for emergency care similar to what is near the bottom of my current webpage (also similar to this)?
- DONE: 8) Under “Pet Services” and when you click on any of the drop-down menu, you go to that page (nice). But when you click on the links to learn more about that service (whether it is “Puppy Wellness”, “”Medical Examination”, “Pain Control”, or anything else), I get this error message:
- UNABLE TO COMPLETE: Content could not be found on site. 9) You mentioned in an earlier email that you could not move over certain pages from the current website to this new website due to copyright issues. Those pages were: Nutrition & Weight Management, Allergies & Dermatology, Dentistry, Surgery, Laser Therapy, Critical Care and Boarding. Most of the information on “Laser Therapy” I got from the makers of our laser therapy machine and rewrote it so I was hoping that would transfer.

- DONE: 2. On home page there is a gallery above the testimonials. See if you are able to able to edit this and just add some test logos. If not let me know so I can push it up to the Dev team
- NOTE: There's a workaround to this but yes we can push it to the dev team. The workaround is I moved the component up above just right below the twig {% page %} and worked fine. this is due to a Portal CSS styling which I could not get the hands on tweaking that hinders it to be edited when on the target spot. After adding a test logo (Client's Logo), I then moved it back to the desired Place
